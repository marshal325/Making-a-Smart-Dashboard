# COVID-19 Cases Around the World

## Introduction
This project is a statistical map of COVID-19 cases across the country around the world. The data sources used include real country and latitude-longitude information, while other details are simulated. The libraries utilized are C3 and mapbox-gl, with mapbox-gl employed for map creation, marking points, and implementing click events. The C3 library is used in conjunction with mapbox's click events to update data in real time. On the left side of the document, I have created two dynamic charts, one bar chart and one line chart, both of which provide a clear visual representation of the data. When clicking on a red dot, the data on the left side updates. This project uses proportional symbol maps, where the size of the symbol varies according to the statistical data, with larger values represented by larger symbols. We had two options: a choropleth map or a proportional symbol map. A choropleth map is a map that uses different colors or shades to show data volumes within different areas. The color depth or shade level of each area reflects the quantity or density of a certain statistical datum, such as population, income, or precipitation, within that area. Choropleth maps are primarily used to display the differences and distribution patterns of data between regions. Proportional symbol maps, on the other hand, use symbols of varying sizes to represent the data volumes of different areas. The size of the symbol is directly proportional to the statistical data, meaning the larger the data value, the larger the symbol. The proportional symbol map offers a more intuitive display, which is why I chose it.
